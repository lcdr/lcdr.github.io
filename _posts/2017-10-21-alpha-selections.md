Hello everyone!

It’s been a week since the application phase ended, and now it’s finally time to announce the results.

First of all, thanks to everyone who submitted an application. In total, we received 303 applications, more than I’d ever have expected. I’m really impressed with how many people are still around who want to play LU, even though the game closed 5 years ago, and how many would apply even though this is just a first alpha. I went ahead and read every one of those 303 applications you sent us, which took a couple of hours, but I felt it was the least I could do to honor your dedication to this game. Your applications were much more than I imagined, with many of you detailing fun moments in original LU, your enthusiasm for the game, and your excitement for being able to play again. It was a great and inspiring read, thanks to you all for taking the time to write all this.

The application system also seems to have worked well to prevent spam; out of 303 applications only 1 was spam (and don’t worry, we didn’t accidentally classify your application as spam, the application in question was a clear impersonation we manually confirmed before disqualifying it).

Now, before continuing with the selections, a note on how the system works: You submitted your application in the application phase. From these 302 applications we selected 20 to be included in the first alpha stage starting on October 26th. The selections were made randomly, using a computer (to be precise, a small python script). However, these 20 people are just the first stage. To evaluate the server performance under load, we’re starting with a small amount, and will add more people in later stages. This also means that if you submitted an application and didn’t get selected, you still have a chance, because your application also counts for the later stages. If you haven’t had a chance to submit your application, you will also still have a chance in later stages, where we will be accepting new applications as well.

Now, on to the selections!

We’re selecting 20 players out of 302 applications, which means if you entered you have a 6.62% chance of being selected.

### The selected players for Stage 1, starting on October 26th, are:

* Komplexus
* Dazoo1
* ethanlindley
* Tinka
* Baffish
* lordpickleking
* Homie0Jr
* emanresU
* Liam3997
* Astrophel
* mater06
* Mickeystick
* Halofan4566
* Matthew
* LS2112
* Raydiation
* DocGrognard
* creeperkid75
* stefanoss
* ShiWham

Congratulations to all of the above. I’m glad the random algorithm provides for so much diversity. We’ve got all kinds of LU fans in there, from original beta testers to live players, to FTP players, to people who never got the chance to play, people from the developer side and people who are engaged in the community, young ones and AFOLs who played LU with their kids. I’m really looking forward to all of them coming together in-game to play LU again.

If you’re one of the selected, check your mail, we will provide you with info on how to connect later today.
If you’re not selected you may still have a chance in later selections, as mentioned above.

And no matter whether you’re selected or not, we will continue to share info about our progress and the alpha with you. You’ll be able to look forward to alpha gameplay videos not only from our youtube, but from the players as well, as we allow streaming and recording of the alpha.

Remember, this all starts on October 26th! I’ve been looking forward to this next step towards everyone being able to play again for years now, and I’m excited that it’s only 5 more days until then.

See you all in-game!
