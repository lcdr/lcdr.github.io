You can make your LU client the Dark Souls of LEGO Games by doing the following:

  1. If you haven&#8217;t already, download and extract the [unpacked client](https://mega.nz/#!zhRzBa4C!B5eY94-6vYmjJYqXkDXDM5hiqkPhZ7yb9ShCHG3Lgo8). The unpacked client allows direct access to the game assets for easy modding. If you&#8217;re not sure whether your client is already unpacked, check for .pk files inside. If there aren&#8217;t any, it&#8217;s an unpacked client.
  2. Optional: Create a copy of the file `/res/ui/ingame/respawndialog.gfx` in your client&#8217;s `/res/ui/ingame/` directory, so that you&#8217;ll be able to revert to the normal UI later.
  3. Download the UI mod zip [here](https://lcdruniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/respawndialog.zip).
  4. Replace the file `<code>/res/ui/ingame/respawndialog.gfx`</code> with the one from the zip. You may need to press `Ok` to confirm the overwrite.
  5. Done. Your client should now show the new respawn dialog whenever you die.

Tip: To respawn, press the `Enter` key.
