Hello!

I'm lcdr (that's a lowercase l, not an uppercase I).

I've been working on restoring LEGO Universe since 2014. I've previously hosted the server project lcdr Universe. Currently I'm working as part of the team at [Darkflame Universe](https://www.darkflameuniverse.org/).

I've also been involved in other projects, such as the [restoration effort](https://github.com/MellonNet/mln-backend-emulator/) for the game My LEGO Network ([Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/VGYgExX)).

### Contact

Contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lcdr_Universe) or on Discord on the [LEGO Universe Community Hub]( https://discord.gg/DBt9h8Q).
